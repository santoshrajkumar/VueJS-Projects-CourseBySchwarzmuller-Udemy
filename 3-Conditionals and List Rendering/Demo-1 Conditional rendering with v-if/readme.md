## Conditional Rendering with v-if

- Keep in mind that if element stopped from rendering with v-if, then Vue removes the element completely.
- v-if can't be used inside the elements of template tag of HTML5.
- v-else-if can also be used with Vue version 2.1+
- Alternative to v-if  is v-show. But, v-show makes elemnts hidden only, it doesn't remove elements completely.
